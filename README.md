# MoviesApp
This is the second project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. It's a cloud-connected Android app called Popular Movies. It presents the user with a grid of movies upon launch, then on tapping on one of the posters, the user is transitioned into details screen for more info about that movie, such as viewing itâ€™s rating, playing trailers or reading its reviews, with the option to mark a movie as a favorite, to be stored in an offline SQLite Database accessed through a Content provider.
